# Constellation-based framework for robust visual servoing

## Methodology

Derive geometric information from unreliable, local features to create reliable, global information that can be used in the context of visual servoing.

This is done through several techniques:
    - Feature selection criteria
    - Geometric hashing
    - Fractal-like constellation preprocessing
