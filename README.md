# Constellation-based framework for robust visual servoing

## Methodology

Produce stable, visual-odometry information from a set of unreliable, local features.

Several techniques are used in combination to achieve this:
- Feature selection using geometric constraints
- Geometric hashing
- Fractal-like constellation preprocessing
