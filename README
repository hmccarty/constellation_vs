# Constellation-based approach to VS

## Methodology

HandleNewFrame()
- Extract features using ORB
- Search points closest to our desired point
    - Assume point is centroid
    - Find features relative to centroid
    - If constellation exists:
        - Check for match
        - If match:
            - Apply jacobian
            - return velocity
    - Else:
        - Store current state as constellation
        - Use features from constellation to generate jacobian
        - Apply jacobian
        - return velocity
